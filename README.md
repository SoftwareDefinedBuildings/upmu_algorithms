# Connecting to the server

The server is 'dists.cal-sdb.org' and you can connect over port 7500. If you are finding that the username and password are not working, it's probably because you forgot the port.

```
ssh -p 7500 user@dists.cal-sdb.org
```

The username and password are distributed out of band, email m.andersen@cs.berkeley.edu if you need to know what they are.
